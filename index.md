# Academics
This section breaks down each part of my academic career.

## Undergraduate
I am a recent graduate of [Penn State University](psu.edu) with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a Bachelor of Science in Data Science, both from the Eberly College of Science. 

I originally started out as an engineering student studying Civil Engineering. I eventually switched my major to every Engineering Major I could find. They all seemed ...*slow*. I loved learning and felt I would benefit from a fast-paced environment so my Father suggested I should try Data Science. I **loved** how in data science, you can quantify and statistically analyze almost anything you want, and it's done with Math, my other passion. After all of this deciding, I decided to shoot for the stars and obtain degrees for each of my loves. It was a lot of work but it was well worth it!

During my time here, I learned many technical skills like how to code, write a proof, and think logically.
> This is true. I first learned how to code as a Sophomore in my Undergrad and was self-taught in the beginning.

I learned many programming languages (Python, R, Java, and SQL to name a few) which have helped me land jobs and other research. 

## Masters
I am now a Masters student attending [Indiana University - Bloomington](iu.edu) obtaining a degree of Science in Data Science.

## Doctorate
Hopefully in the future, I will be able to obtain a PhD to fully round out my academic career and endeavors. I would like to obtain my PhD in researching Quantum Machine Learning and Machine Learning for Mathematical Applications. I will touch on these more in the next section.

### Research Interests
1. *Quantum* - Since high school, I have been interested in the world of Quantum. First, it was true mechanics in understanding how this bizarre system works. Secondly, over time with more hardened computer skills, I stumbled upon Quantum Computing. With this and my love for Data Science, I found myself at the end of the path: Quantum Machine Learning. 
>I am amazed at how we, as humans, are able to extract proabablistic notions of our universe, extract them as entirely new bit storage and operations (qubit), and successfully employ Machine Learning algorithms to predict these bit operations.
